For the graphics and visual design of the game, you will need to:

- Create a design for the spaceship and the asteroids that is similar to the original game.
- Choose a color scheme and create a background for the game.
- Design an explosion effect when the asteroids are destroyed.

## User Controls

## Game Difficulty
The game will have the following difficulty levels:

- The game will start with a basic level of difficulty.
- The difficulty will increase as the player progresses through the game by adding more asteroids or increasing their speed.
